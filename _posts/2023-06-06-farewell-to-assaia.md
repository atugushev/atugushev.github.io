# Farewell to Assaia

Today marks the end of an exceptional journey that I have been on for the past 3.5 years - my journey with [Assaia](https://www.assaia.com) has finally come to a close. It’s been one heck of a ride!

I must admit, it wasn't just another job for me. I was jumped into an environment peopled by some of the most skilled and talented brains around. The learning curve was steep, sure, but that's where the fun was!

What's more, Assaia has been the first company where I've been enveloped by an intense feeling of being taken care of. They haven't just been a company or an organization; they’ve been my family.

And oh, the product! You MUST check out the [demo](https://demo.assaia.com). It's quite a marvel! What started as an ambitious project is now an amazing service that's doing wonders for the aviation industry by reducing flight delays and enhancing safety. Seriously - go check it out - this what dispatchers in the towers see on their monitors.

Over these years, I've worked on and contributed to numerous services; I've pretty much created or had a hand in most of them. Together, we've built a core product that's evolved from a solution suitable for small airports/airlines to one that fits into the infrastructure of large airports such as Seattle Tacoma and JFK. Talk about evolution!

A massive shout-out to my closest teammates [@lig](https://github.com/lig), [@Ivashkaization](https://github.com/Ivashkaization) and [@albshady](https://github.com/albshady). Without them, I wouldn't have achieved half the learning and skills that I proudly possess today. I’ll always be grateful.

For numbers’ freaks, here are some quick stats:

- Merged Pull Requests: 1111
- Closed Issues: 434
- Contributed Projects: 40

As I close the Assaia chapter of my life, I take away a lifetime of lessons, memories, and experiences. The journey ahead is unknown, but if it's anything like the past 3.5 years, I’m super excited!

So long, Assaia! It's been a pleasure.
